# Problem

One of the reasons R has become so popular is because of its first-class implementation of literate programming. The seamless integration of code and text made possible by `Sweave`, `knitr`, and `Rmarkdown`, has not only allowed users to write reproducible reports, it has also made possible to write a variety of teaching materials such as tutorials, books, and courses. However, these tools lack the features that are expected from teaching materials, and authors of these teaching materials have to recreate them in ways that are not portable to other contexts. Here, we propose to write an R package that relies on existing tools such as `knitr` and `bookdown`, to meet the needs of authors of teaching materials. We are especially interested in building resources that foster collaborative development for code-rich lessons, as it is our aim in The Carpentries.

This package tentatively named `lessondown`, will facilitate the development of consistent teaching resources while encouraging best practices by having markup and templates available for the elements needed in teaching materials such as "learning objectives", "keypoints", "exercises" and their solutions. By providing the technical framework for developing quality teaching materials, we want to encourage collaborative lesson development by letting authors focus on the content rather than the formatting, while providing a more consistent experience for the learners.

Development efforts for the tools associated with teaching materials for R have mainly focused on creating interactive learning environments as demonstrated by the [`tutorial` package](https://github.com/datacamp/tutorial) by DataCamp, and the [`learnr` package](https://github.com/rstudio/learnr) by RStudio. In both cases, the learner is provided with some code in an editor window, and a R terminal running in the cloud that are embedded within the text of the lesson. The work proposed here comes in complement to these efforts. Both `tutorial` and `learnr` rely on the rmarkdown package to process the source of the lesson material to convert them into their respective output formats. The goal of `lessondown` is to provide additional markup that would be compatible with these packages to provide structure and guidelines that pedagogical research have indicated support and improve learning. The template that `lessondown` will provide would also be compatible as a static, self-contained website making it easy to distribute and teach in remote places where internet connection is not ubiquitous. 



# The Plan

We will develop an R package that provides flexible and easy-to-use templates specifically designed for teaching materials. This package will provide styling elements (e.g., HTML/CSS and LaTeX), and templates to encourage the inclusion of the elements needed in teaching materials. These include pre-requisites, learning objectives, the "call out" boxes, exercises, their solutions, and the estimated time it takes for teaching and going through the exercises.

We are not planning on re-inventing any wheels, instead we will leverage the flexibility that `knitr`, `rmarkdown`, and `bookdown` provide to create [knitr engines](https://yihui.name/knitr/demo/engines/), make use of Rmarkdown [templates](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/developer_document_templates.html), and [parametrized reports](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/developer_parameterized_reports.html) to make easily accessible to lesson creators the elements they need in their teaching.

Using a consistent template for teaching materials will not only make lessons more modular, facilitating re-use and re-mix of the content (when the authors chose a license that allows it), it will also make it easier for the community to contribute and improve the material.

The package will include ways to check the teaching material follows some of the best practices using automated checks in a way that is similar to what [`goodpractice`](https://github.com/MangoTheCat/goodpractice) does for package development. We will also provide the scripts and configuration files needed to take advantage of continuous integration (e.g. Travis CI) to run these automated checks, check spelling, and broken links, and built the rendered version of the lesson when the lesson changes.

We will leverage The Carpentries' experience building collaborative online teaching materials, test the package on our dozens of lessons, and receive support from our community of lesson contributors and maintainers to get feedback on its features and usability.

This package is the first step of a larger project aimed at facilitating teaching material discoverability, and attribution. Next steps will involve the development of a metadata standard for teaching material (similarly to efforts for software such as [codemeta](https://codemeta.github.io)), and a website repository to list and find tutorials and lessons.

## Timeline

The Carpentries is uniquely positioned to implement this project as we have dozens of lessons that we can use as a test bed for this package. We will test the initial versions of the package against an increasing number of our lessons, and adapt the package based on the feedback from our community. Our lessons cover a variety of software and discipline ensuring that the package we will develop will be useful across many contexts.

* Week 1-3: Implementation of the initial version of `lessondown` package.
* Weeks 4-19: 4 cycles of 4 weeks, with tests of the package on an increasing number of lessons at each cycle.

    - week a: conversion of existing lessons to `lessondown`
    - week b-c: evaluate package and ask feedback from community
    - week d: implement changes
  
        + For weeks 4-7: We'll work on [Data Carpentry R Ecology lesson](http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson).
  
        + For weeks 8-11: We'll work on Software Carpentry R lessons: [R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/) and [Programming with R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/)
  
        + For weeks 12-15: We'll test lessondown on our Geospatial and Genomics Curricula
  
        + For weeks 16-19: We'll use lessondown on all our lessons.
  
* Weeks 20-22: Finalize package and submit to CRAN


## Failure modes and recovery

# The Team

The Carpentries is a non-profit organization resulting from the merger of Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry. The Carpentries is a global community of 1,300+ trained instructors, who have taught workshops that have reached 30,000+ learners. Our workshops teach introductory computing and data analytical skills to researchers. R is taught in more than half of our workshops. All the lessons materials are available for free, under a Creative Commons Attribution License, and have been developed by hundreds of contributors. We render our lesson material using a custom Jekyll template. This template is difficult to use, maintain, and yet instructors use it outside The Carpentries because of the structure and features it provides. It also seems that some people want to have this static learnr template as indicated in this [issue](https://github.com/rstudio/learnr/issues/114).

Fran√ßois Michonneau is the Curriculum Development Lead for The Carpentries, and is an experienced R developer. He implemented the integration between the Jekyll lesson template and Rmarkdown used by The Carpentries. He will lead the development of this package.
